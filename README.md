# 11747 Assignment 3
This repo mainly contains implementation and instance attribution analysis of VAE models on the CelebA dataset. The implementation of VAE is largely forked from [here](https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE) whereas the analysis is by us. To generate pickle files that contain influence scores, run `script.sh` which would further calls `run_influence.py`. Code for visualization can be found in `analysis.ipynb`.
